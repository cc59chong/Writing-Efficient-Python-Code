## Discription

### Chapters 1 and 2 

### Chapter 3 
### Chapter 4 Basic pandas optimizations
This chapter offers a brief introduction on how to efficiently work with pandas DataFrames. You'll learn the various options you have for iterating over a DataFrame. Then, you'll learn how to efficiently apply functions to data stored in a DataFrame.
* `.iterrows()`, `.itertuples()`, `.apply()`, `lambda`, `.values` (array approach) <br>
***Using NumPy arrays was the fastest approach, followed by the .itertuples() approach, and the .apply() approach was slowest.***
